# PrettyObject

PrettyObject is a Java library that converts Java objects into human readable strings.
PrettyObject heavily uses Java reflection API to dive deep into Java objects and extract every bit of information out of them.
PrettyObject is inspired by [Awesome Print](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print).

# Build
Run the following command

```
./gradlew build
```
on Unix like machines or

The script downloads all the requirements, including `gradle`, and build the library.
